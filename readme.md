## A project base for building modern JavaScript applications

Maintained by @benhowdle89 and @Jack_Franklin.

### Features

* Not a framework, but a base project to help you structure your JavaScript code and files.
* Templating built in - Handlebars is included but feel free to change engines.
* Uses RequireJS for managing modules and dependencies.
* Included: jQuery, Underscore.js and Handlebars.
* A fully commented source to show you why it's doing what it's doing and how to build upon it's foundation.
* The JavaScript version of the HTML5 Boilerplate
* Uses Twitter's Bower library for managing components.

### Getting Started

* Download the repository, either as a zip file from Github or simply by cloning it: `git clone git@github.com:benhowdle89/heisenberg.git`
* You'll need NodeJS and npm installed. npm comes with Node. You can install Node through Homebrew (`brew install node`) or download installers from the [Node website](http://nodejs.org/).
* Then install Bower: `npm install -g bower`
* Run `bower install` to download all the libraries (by default this is jQuery, RequireJS, Handlebars and Underscore)
* Job done!
