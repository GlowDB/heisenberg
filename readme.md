# Heisenberg.js

## A project base for building modern JavaScript applications

### Features

* Not a framework, but a base project to help you structure your JavaScript code and files.
* Makes use of the Mediator Pattern, so you can trigger events around your application.
* Templating built in - Handlebars is included but feel free to change engines.
* Follows the Object Literal Pattern with one global namespace, usually 'myApp' or 'chatApp'. In this case, it's 'breakingBad'.
* Included: jQuery, Underscore.js and Handlebars.
* A fully commented source to show you why it's doing what it's doing and how to build upon it's foundation.
* The JavaScript version of the HTML5 Boilerplate
